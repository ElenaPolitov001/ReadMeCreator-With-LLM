As a developer with years of experience, your task is to write the documentation for the project you are developing. This documentation will include an introduction to the purpose of the project, as well as a definition of the structure of the code. You will also need to attach the purpose of each specific component within the code. This involves reading through all the code that makes up the project and documenting its purpose and structure accordingly.
